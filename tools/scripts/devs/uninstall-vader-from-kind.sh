# Purpose: This script will allow devs to uninstall a local Vader instance from Kubernetes-IN-Docker KIND.
#          It assumes that KIND is installed and available globally via the command line,
#          and that Helm and Kubectl have been installed.

echo Uninstalling Vader from KIND cluster...

# Check that 'kind' is available in the path
if ! command -v kind &> /dev/null; then
    echo "ERROR: 'kind' command not found. Please install KIND and ensure it's available in your PATH."
    exit 1
fi

# Optional: Check Helm and kubectl are also available
for cmd in helm kubectl; do
    if ! command -v "$cmd" &> /dev/null; then
        echo "ERROR: '$cmd' command not found. Please install $cmd and ensure it's available in your PATH."
